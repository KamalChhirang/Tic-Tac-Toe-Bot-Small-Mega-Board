# Tic-Tac-Toe-Bot-Small-Mega-Board
I created a Bot that plays Tic Tac Toe game on 3x3 board &amp; 5x5 board. You can play this game here: https://moviesre.com/tictactoe

I created this game by using HTML, CSS for graphic user Interface & Javascript for programming. I used Minimax, Alpha Beta Purning agorithm. The game tree size for 3x3 board is quite small and the bot is unbeatable. The board of 10x10 game is very large, and the bot is very hard to beat.
